Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a baking sheet. Mash black beans in a bowl; add onion and garlic. Mix. Whisk cornstarch, water, chile-garlic sauce, chili powder, cumin, seafood seasoning, salt, and pepper together in a separate small bowl. Stir cornstarch mixture into black bean mixture. Mix whole-wheat bread into bean mixture. Stir flour, 1/4 cup at a time, into bean mixture until a sticky batter forms. Spoon 'burger-sized' mounds of batter onto the prepared baking sheet, about a 3/4-inch thickness per mound. Shape into burgers. Bake in the preheated oven until cooked in the center and crisp in the outside, about 10 minutes on each side.
